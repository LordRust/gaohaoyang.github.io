## Why a new blog?

Starting a personal blog in 2019? And for now with crummy old content in Swedish? Well, at least this is the humble beginnings of a new blog. Hopefully there will be bits and pieces for various people here. The idea to make a proper blog came about when [Google announced that Google+ was discontinued for consumers](https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/). I looked around in my g+ profile and found a series of posts I made when fixing up some Commodore retro computers that I made in 2015. So I decided to rescue them from the digital graveyard and put them here.



## Work

In my day to day life I work as a microbiologist/sysadmin/bioinformatician at [clinical molecular diagnostics lab](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/clinical-genomics-lund/) at the University hospital in Lund. My work is mostly with DNA/RNA sequncing at a large scale, from microbes to whole genome sequencing of humans. previously I worked 10 years at the [Danish public health institute SSI](https://en.ssi.dk/about-us/contact/departments/b/bacteria-parasites-and-fungi) with surveiallance and outbreak detection. Over the years I have published some [scientific papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YR9heVIAAAAJ&hl=en). So, some posts about microbiology or molecular genetics is not out of the question.

## Play
![Wooden flute](/images/flute.jpg)

In my spare time I love to make music and sing in a [choir](http://mollevangensvokalensemble.se/). I have a soft spot for Swedish folk music where my main instrument is the [wooden transverse flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_system_flute), sometimes more well known as an [Irish flute](http://www.irishfluteguide.info/). I play together with some [likeminded fluters](http://transverseflute.blogspot.com/) and when possible with [Lustspel](http://www.lustspel.com/) in Lund. I also play guitar trying to re-learn to play with an alternative modal tuning of B-E-B-E-B-E - something that has proved itself to be interesting.... My violin is sorely neglected in its case. Last year i recorded, mixed and mastered a [CD with some of my best friends](https://trinning.se/) (including my wife) and it turned out quite nice.
